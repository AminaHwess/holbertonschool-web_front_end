# Sass Project

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General:
- **What Sass means**  
  Sass stands for **Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets**. It is a CSS preprocessor that makes writing CSS easier and more powerful by adding features like variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance, and more.

- **How to write Sass & SCSS files**  
  Sass comes in two syntaxes:  
  - **Sass**: Indentation-based syntax with no braces or semicolons.  
  - **SCSS**: CSS-like syntax with braces and semicolons, which is more familiar to most developers.

- **What is the difference between Sass and SCSS**  
  - **Sass** is the older syntax that doesnâ€™t require braces `{}` and semicolons `;`. It uses indentation for structure.  
  - **SCSS** is a more recent syntax that is fully compatible with CSS, and you write it in a way that looks similar to CSS with braces and semicolons.

- **What is Sass preprocessing**  
  Sass preprocessing involves writing styles in a more powerful, feature-rich syntax (Sass or SCSS) and then compiling those styles into standard CSS that the browser can interpret. The preprocessing step allows you to take advantage of variables, mixins, nesting, and other advanced features.

- **How to declare a variable**  
  Sass allows you to define variables using the `$` symbol. Variables can store values like colors, fonts, or other CSS properties. For example:

  ```scss
  $primary-color: #3498db;
