## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Explain **Mobile-first design** and its importance.
- Understand and implement **media queries**.
- Choose appropriate **sizes** for responsive web design.
- Create a website that is fully **responsive**.
- Differentiate between **responsive** and **adaptive** design approaches.

## Features of This Project
1. **Mobile-First Design**:
   - The project prioritizes design for smaller screens and scales up for larger devices.
   - Ensures better usability and performance on mobile devices.

2. **Media Queries**:
   - Dynamic styling based on screen size using CSS media queries.
   - Breakpoints implemented to provide an optimal layout for various screen widths.

3. **Flexible Sizes**:
   - Responsive units such as `em`, `rem`, `%`, `vw`, and `vh` are used.
   - Images and elements scale proportionally without losing aspect ratio.

4. **Responsive Website**:
   - The design adjusts seamlessly across different devices, from smartphones to desktops.

5. **Difference Between Responsive and Adaptive Design**:
   - **Responsive**: Uses fluid grids and flexible layouts to adapt dynamically.
   - **Adaptive**: Uses fixed layouts tailored for specific screen sizes.

## CSS Units Overview
- **Relative Units**:
  - `em` and `rem` for scalable text.
  - `%` for layout proportions.
- **Viewport Units**:
  - `vw` (viewport width) and `vh` (viewport height) for full-screen layouts.
